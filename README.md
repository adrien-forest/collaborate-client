# Collaborate app - Client
 
To install the app:
- clone the repo

Before starting the client, have the [server](https://github.com/adrien-forest/collaborate-server) running first.

This project is using:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
